    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really love cruisecontrol.rb in a team environment.  The ability to run tests against every commit is great, and it is such fun being the &ldquo;build police&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>Excuse me sir, can I see your license to commit please?</p></blockquote>

<p>We can have some fun with that one.</p>

<blockquote><p>This license expired just before the dotcom bubble</p>

<p>You have a languague restriction here that says you can commit only while wearing vb.net</p>

<p>I need to see some proof of build collision insurance.</p></blockquote>

<p>But I digress. Sorry, back to the program.</p>

<p>As rails grows, I have some questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Where the heck is code for cruise control?</p></li>
<li><p> Can I use git?</p></li>
<li><p> Will it run against rails 2.1 since I am security conscience and have updated after the recent <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/06/20/arbitrary-code-execution-vulnerabilities/">warnings</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/08/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-ruby/">threats</a>?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Let&rsquo;s do some research.  The code used to be at <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/cruisecontrolrb/">rubyforge</a>.  Looks like the code is still there.  However, according to this <a href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/cruisecontrolrb-users/2008-August/000560.html">post</a>, they are moving to github.  The link in that post has an extra *, but sure enough, you can find cruisecontrol.rb at <a href="http://github.com/thoughtworks/cruisecontrol.rb">http://github.com/thoughtworks/cruisecontrol.rb</a>.  Cool, now I know where to get it.</p>

<p>What about git support?  A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cruisecontrolrb+git&amp;btnG=Google+Search">google search</a>, turns up <a href="http://github.com/benburkert/cruisecontrolrb/tree/master">benburkert</a>&rsquo;s github branch.  Looks promising.  Searching git hub for <a href="http://github.com/search?q=cruisecontrolrb">cruisecontrol.rb</a> shows several forks, but these are all from rubyforge git.  I want it straight from thoughtworks.  Digging a little in the code shows it is already in the thoughtworks master.  There is even a mercurial adapter.  Let&rsquo;s give it a try.  Sure enough, it works just fine with</p>

<pre><code>cruise add projectname -r file:///home/me/src/gitproject -s git
</code></pre>

<p>Run</p>

<pre><code>cruise help add
</code></pre>

<p>for all the options.</p>

<p>Great, 2 for 2.  Now what about support for Rails 2.1?   Unfortunately, it is not there.  Cruisecontrol.rb currently runs with rails 1.2.3, and a simple version change in environment.rb doesn&rsquo;t fix it.  (Didn&rsquo;t figure it would but I had to try it right?)   For all of us who have updated to ruby 1.8.7, we are stuck for now.  Ruby 1.8.7 only runs rails 2.1.  My <a href="http://www.mjwall.com/2008/08/multiple-versions-of-ruby-with-stow/">last</a> post about multiple version of ruby doesn&rsquo;t really help either.</p>

<p>I did find this post answered by the team about porting cruisecontrol to <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re:-Plans-to-upgrade-to-Rails-2.1--td18115378.html">merb</a>.  That sounds interesting indeed.</p>

<p>Until then, who is working on a rails 2.1 version of cruisecontrol.rb?</p>
