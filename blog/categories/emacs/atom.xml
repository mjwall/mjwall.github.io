    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I came across a theme for Emacs called Ample at
<a href="https://github.com/jordonbiondo/ample-theme">https://github.com/jordonbiondo/ample-theme</a>.  I loved the colors and
general feel of the theme and starting using it immediately.  It
worked great and I really like it.  The only issues I had was that
<a href="https://github.com/senny/rbenv.el" title="rbenv.el">rbenv.el</a>
in the modeline was an ugly red and the theme didn&rsquo;t work in the
terminal.  So I started poking at the theme code.  It is the first time I
have ever opened up a theme and looked at tweaking it.</p>

<p>Along the way, I started looking at other themes.  I kept coming back
to zenburn-emacs at <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs</a>. I liked
the way the code was organized and the little touches like
automatically starting up
<a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/rainbow-mode.html" title="rainbow-mode">rainbow-mode</a>, which I had never used.</p>

<p>So I decided to try and combining the colors from Ample and the code
from Zenburn into one theme.  My result is available at
<a href="https://github.com/mjwall/ample-zen">https://github.com/mjwall/ample-zen</a>.  Zenburn had a bigger palette
than Ample, so I added in some colors.  I removed packages that I
don&rsquo;t use, and added some, like rbenv, that I do.  For me, the
modeline in the active window is important, so I tried to make that
stand out.  It appears to work OK running Emacs in the terminal as well.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot</p>

<p>All the credit goes to Jordon Biondo for his colors in Ample and
Bozhidar Batsov for his code in Zenburn-Emacs.  Ample-Zen is currently
available in Marmalade and a pull request has been merged to MELPA.
