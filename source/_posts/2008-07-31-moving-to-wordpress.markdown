Alright, I give.  Rails on shared hosting really sucks.  I've seen reports of success with [Phusion Passenger](http://modrails.com/), but my [host](http://refer.asmallorange.com/10815) doesn't support it yet.  I wrote about my some of this [issues](/?p=13) I have had.  So welcome to wordpress.  Same theme, mostly, with less crashes.  Maybe this will encourage me to write more.
