Since my last post, I have been looking more and more at Merb.  Just some random notes




  * Looks like Merb 0.9.2 got some fcgi [love](http://github.com/wycats/merb-more/commit/b5467e5138b8c18c0c521a5fce5ea529f1a090d6). That is what I want to try to replace rails on my shared host.


  * Get on IRC if you need help – irc.freenode.net#merb.  Really, IRC.


  * If you can’t stay on IRC, go to [http://groups.google.com/group/merb](http://groups.google.com/group/merb) for a log


  * Use these [sake](http://www.gweezlebur.com/2008/3/1/quickie-sake-tasks-for-merb-hackers) tasks if you are running the latest.  `sudo sake merb:update merb:install` will update core, more and plugins


  * merb-rspec is no longer in plugins, but included in core


  * Watch this from [Confreaks](http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/02zygmuntowicz.html).  Worth the investment.


  * Most tutorials and articles are dated.  [This](http://crazycool.co.uk/blog/2008/3/17/Adventures+in+Merb/) one helped though.


Looking forward to more from merb….

UPDATE:  Having some trouble with typo’s caching.  Going to repost this article.
