One more quick post.  Last week I purchased an inexpensive (shall I say cheap) laptop from WalMart.  It is a [Toshiba A215-S5808](http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/rdet.jsp?poid=404159&seg=HHO).  I booted once in Vista to burn a cd and them immediately installed [Ubuntu 7.10](http://www.ubuntu.com/).  Almost all my hardware was recognized, except the wireless and sound.  This [post](http://www.datanorth.net/~cuervo/blog/linux-on-the-satellite-a215-s7407/) was very helpful in resolving those issues.  It’s only been a week, but I keep asking myself, “Why did I code so long in Windows”.
