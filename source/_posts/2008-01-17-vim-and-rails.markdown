I do almost all my development using [vim/gvim](http://www.vim.org/).  Vim is great.  Yes, I have tried IDEs, and will use Eclipse when doing some java work.  Ever since I started developing in Rails though, it has been me and vim.

I see lots of posts with rails code.  Many of them are from Textmate, a Mac text editor, and the [VibrantInk](http://alternateidea.com/blog/articles/2006/1/3/textmate-vibrant-ink-theme-and-prototype-bundle) color scheme looks great.  I already use [rails.vim](http://rails.vim.tpope.net/) which is a great plugin by Tim Pope for rails development.  He has also released a color scheme based on VibrantInk called [vividchalk](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1891).  There is another VibrantInk port for vim oddly enough called [vibrantink.vim](http://blog.jozilla.net/2006/10/05/vibrantink-theme-for-vim/).  Both are really good, but I use the vibrantink.vim color scheme getter for couple of reasons.  One, it looks better in console vim.  Two, the italics in vividchalk through me off.

Here is a screenshot from [flicker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/37743236@N00/952130787/) with a comparison of the 3 made by Jo Vermeulen, the guy who made vibrantink.vim
